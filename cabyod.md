# why did it come about #

- at first it was very diffcult to get email of phone or outside the office so once people were able to they got use to it very quickly. compaines also like having staff that could reply to emails all the time. this became a big advantage for the compaines that could reply to emails as they could comunincate much better with staff then before. allowing staff to work together better when out of the office. As more and more compaines started having staff with acces to there email it no longer became an advantage but a requirment.  

When Research in Motion(RIM) first launched a pager that allowed customers to recive email on the go it changed how people work. While it wouldn't be for a couple more years that people really saw the power of what this device and software was capablte of. It was still popular and useful enoght that poeple wanted to use it. The pager itself was nothing inusal but it the server package that came with it was very clever. Simpley, compaines have there email server for example exchange it recviveces an email and sents it to the outlook of the person meant for. Blackberry Entrprise Server(BES) also sees that there is an email recvieved. BES encripts the email, compressed it and sents it to the device over a mobile or wireless network. The device the decrupts and uncompressed the message. Today this may not sound so impressvie but for the late 90's and early 00's this was truely inovatve product.
While getting the email is a great selling point the real key was with compression and encruptions. In the early 00's mobile networks were not nearly and good or build up as they are now. It would take serval seconds for a simply html website to load to attempting to get a email while on the road was going to a challage. Having a the email and attachments compressed meant that it wasn't stress the mobile carriers network to much. The encription allowed compaines the peace of mind that the informaction that previously would have never left the walls of their office builds couldn't be intercepted and read by anyone else. As the benfit outweighted the cons BES and RIM devices were wildly successful in the corprate world. employee become use to have there email always at arms reach. Compaines became use to have there employees at arms reach. 
There was of course problems with these RIM devices(Now just known as Blackberry). They had a learning curve to them. When they first came out this wasn't to much of a problem for a couple of reasons. The benafit was a strong enough insentave to learn how to use the device. There wasn't much compation that could offer anything as good. The people that used the first blackberrys found themselves very use to them so found anything else was diffcult to use. However while they had learned to use the device that allowed them to work best for the time. Newer devices were catching up. There also was an explosion in how phones worked and the price point. all this mean that people no longer had to use the device that they didn't understand. The other phones on the market were easier to use and from the users point of view that didn't see why they couldn't use them. While maybe there was some benafit in having a device that could compress the data traffic being used espicaly when you have 100's of employees. However mobile networks became much better and faster. It wasn't the issue it once was. 
all this meant that people start requesting the different phones which they could use. compines no longer need to buy expensive BES software. While this was great in some cases there still was a learning curve and some people just didn't like there work phone. also having to carry around two devices all the time wasn't conventante. Employees were using the same type of phone for work and personal. So why not just allow them to use the personal phone for work as well. 
This is were Bring your own device comes from. If you give someone who isn't intrested in techonlgy and phone that's different to there's they are going to have to take time to learn it. Maybe they will be unhappy with using it so won't and it will just sit in a drawer. allows employees to use there own phone has showen to be a reason why someone would choose one job over another. It allows them to not worry about getting use to a differnt device or worry about forgetting or breaking it. 

# How does it work 

## before setting up 

before getting started company poilces should be outline and set in place. Each company is going to be differnt but it should be asked what is the reason for having a compane device. Are employees expected to be in a 24/7 support role or are they just trying to get better teamwork within the team. Are they going to private documents downloaded to the device? Are polices going to be enforced on the phone(password protected, device encripted) How will backups work? picture stored what about company pictures? is there going to be any compensition for employees for using there phone's data plan? If the phone is stolen who pays for the replament.
There are many questions that must be addressed when setting up a BYOD in a place of work. They also need to be explained to the employee before any any work in done with there personal device. Explained that there personal photo's were not backed up with the rest of the phone when done with the company servers could be a very sore topic to discuss after a device has been wiped or stolen. This should be clear before had. It should also be clear just who owns the device. 
These are some of a number of things that compines and employees should be clear about before starting to implament a BYOD system in the work place.In most cases compaines can decide on these with there company poilcy. The poily will enforce how often that staf will have to chnage thier password word and how strong it should be. This will not only hekp keep the device scure but also ensure that everyone is complaying with company poilcy.

## What Software to use (MDM)

Mobile Device Managmet software allows compianes to accoumadate personal devices on the company netowrk. It can also be used for company bought devices. Genarlly it works with a server componate which will sends the company commands to the device. The device that is trying to actvivetd on the network will have allready installed the app which will then be used to sign in to the company network.
For example the company already has a exchange active dirtory set up. it split up into sales and accounts staff. The staff in the accounts department can have access to more senative data that the sales staff so they will have and different more strict poily in place. When a member of the sales staff logs in with the account the MDM sends down the poily to their device and downloads any apps that they may need. The poilies could be how type of password they should be using and maybe if loctaion service should be turned on if they are traveling around the country. For accounts staff the poily wouldn't need to check the location of the staff as they wouldn't be travling as much as sales but it may require a strong password to be chonse and a shorter lock screen time as they would have access to more private data.  
In both caese the employee has doesn't need to know anything speical to get the device working on the company network. The piolcy and required apps are already set up by the IT staff when they set up the MDM. This allows then to very easly keep track of what s isntalled on each device and can say with comfidence that everyone is keeping the data secure to comapny standards. The applcatione that are downloaded can come from the mobile app store such as Google Play Store or a secure MDM server app store that has all the apps that are used within the company. This makes sure that the email client and other standand apps which may not be scure enough for the compaines poilcy aren't being used but still giving staff the convenice of having email on them at all times. Other apps which may not have been condisered before but which can also be a serious threat to keeping comapny data private can also be scured. A note takig app it a good example this. Proving the note app the apilty to sync back to the employees laptop will show them the benafit of not using the standard app which may not be fit for purpose.  
In this case the device is being used for both company and personal. This is ok and doesn't afect the employee to much it also allows IT to know that documents are being stored securely. The company poilcy is being followed. In the event of a device being lost of stolen all the 

in the Mobile Device Managment space there are many different suites you can use. Two that this paper will focus on are. Citrix XenMobile and Blackberry UEM. 


# What is BYOD #

- why is it being used 
- what where the preivios chooses 
- employees like it 
- saves money 

# how does it work for the company #

- set up device on the network 
- adding corprate apps 
- company and personal apps work side by side
- should be setting up different space for comapny apps 

# Advanagtes # 

- employees like using there own device. 
	* can make them happy or choose one company over another
	* more comorbale using there own. less training. famillar 
	* can stay on top of work
- less spent of compaines hardware budget
- devices are scure. know that the company apps are working on te net work. 
-

# Disavntages #

- phone or other item is more likely to scrituy breachs
- loss or stolen means that company data is gone. 
- IT have to cover a wide range of devices. much harder to keep patched or on the lastest software. 
- employee unhappy if a stolen phone has personal photos wiped because its lost. 
- fruad item used more often employee will may download something which is harmful or connecting to a dodgey wifi connection. 
- who owns the device? if it breaks who pays ? does it have to be a offical repair or will the dodgey IT lad be ok. 


# shadow IT #

you can't stop people from bring there device to work. they are always going to have there phone on them. at this stage its more about how you can best mange that device. Better training for staff. Not allowing them you use there phones, computers or tablets for work. company data being leaked could be very bad for the compaines image or scureity. With new regulations companies can no longer hide about this information got out there.
