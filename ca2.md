# abstrct 

this paper will dicuss the changs made in the new us-eu 
Privcy Shield framwork. The us-eu Privcy Shield is the 
replaement for the now defeated Safe Harbour rule. Both 
Safe Harbour and Privacy Shieldaims to protect EU citsens 
data being  stored on servers located in the US. This is 
only accpacble if the company storeing the data can 
ensure it is complying with the guidles outlines in the 
framworks. 

# What is Safe Harbour

## whats wrong with it 

With the Snodwon revalations it showed that US agenies 
NSA was undertaken a mass survailce on US cistens. This 
was being done on a indascrimet basis by access servers 
which could have had both US and EU cistizen data. This is 
a vilaltion on EU rights and in turn violates the Safe 
Harbour framework. Safe Harbour in itself is not a law but 
rather a guideline for compaines to andhear too. As there 
are some very strict laws in place with europan citezens 
data and how it can be stored and transfered. following 
the guidelines allow compaines to have the reasureanice 
that they are in compliance with any law.
