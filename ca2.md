# Introduction  

this paper will discuss the changes made in the new us-eu 
Privacy Shield framework. The us-eu Privacy Shield is the 
replacement for the now defeated Safe Harbour rule. Both 
Safe Harbour and Privacy Shield aim to protect EU citizens 
data being stored on servers located in the US. This is 
only acceptable if the company storing the data can 
ensure it is complying with the guidelines outlines in the 
frameworks. 

# Background


## What is Safe Harbour

To understand what Privacy Shield is its important to know where it came from and why it is being used. US-EU Privacy Shield is the replacement for Safe Harbour Privacy Principles most often simply referred to as Safe Harbour. The term Safe Harbour means an agreement that allows protection for liability once certain conditions are met. @Whatsafeharbor. What this means is that safe harbour is not a law but a guideline that allows companies to act in confidence that they are not breaking any laws in place around the area which they are working in. 
For the Safe Harbour Privacy Principles outlines a number of principles that US companies could follow to be in compliance with the EU's Data Protection Directive. This allows us companies like facebook and google to store data that they may have on EU citizens on servers located outside of the EU.

##  why is is necessary 

Within the Eu there are very strict privacy laws. The Data Protection Directive Provides @EURLex31995L0046 protection to EU citizens regarding the processing of personal data. In the EU citizens data is protected under the Human Rights law. The right to privacy is strongly enforced by all members of the EU. This is much stricter then within the US. This is why the Safe Harbour Privacy Principles was first created.  While safe Harbour didn't have any legally binding, It allows US companies to comply with laws from another jurisdiction. The OECD issued seven principles _Notice, Purpose, Consent, Security, Disclosure, Access and Accountability_ . @OECDGuidelinesProtection which the US endorsed but didn't give any fines if they were not followed. 

### Seven Principles

* __Notice__ - People should be to when they data is being collected

* __Purpose__ - Should be clear what the data is being used for and not used for any other reasons 

* __Consent__ - personal data should not be disclosed with the users consent 

* __Security__ - any data stored should be store securely 

* __Disclosure__ - people should be informed as to who is collecting thier data 

* __Access__ - people should be allowed access the data and correct any mistakes 

* __Accountability__ - anyone collecting data must have someone who is held accountable in the event the above rules are not followed

These were not binding as even within the EU there are different privacy laws in each country. This is one of the reasons the Data Protection Directive was created, it helps the free flow of data within the EU. 

## What did it solve 

While Safe Harbour is not perfect it did help the free flow of data between compaines that are outside the EU and those within. While people may not think this is a good thing from a privacy point of view. In the current age of cloud computing and SaaS busniess models it effects more then just users social media data. Workday are a company which have taken avantage are selling SaaS and advcats of free flowing data as it adds values to there product. @ShaughnessyWhyWorkdayAdvocates2017  
 
 > Our position is that national or other jurisdictionsâ€™ data localization requirements are a well-meaning but ineffective means to ensuring data privacy and security


## whats wrong with it 

Safe harbour was an agrement which allowed companines to store data from european citizens in servers locatated outside of the EU. This enabled compaines like google and facebook to keep any data they may have on EU citizens in servers located in the US. Under Safe Harbour this was fine as long as where the data was being stored was scure.
    While Safe Harbour is not a law itself but a regulation that allows the compaines that follow it assurances that they are complying with the rules that are in place for data production and privacy for eu citizens. What this meant for compaines was that if they followed Safe Harbour they would be comply with the Data Protection Drirective 


With the Snodwon revalations it showed that US agenies 
NSA was undertaken a mass survailce on US cistens. This 
was being done on a indascrimet basis by access servers 
which could have had both US and EU cistizen data. This is 
a vilaltion on EU rights and in turn violates the Safe 
Harbour framework. Safe Harbour in itself is not a law but 
rather a guideline for compaines to andhear too. As there 
are some very strict laws in place with europan citezens 
data and how it can be stored and transfered. following 
the guidelines allow compaines to have the reasureanice 
that they are in compliance with any law.
