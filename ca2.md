# abstrct 

this paper will dicuss the changs made in the new us-eu 
Privcy Shield framwork. The us-eu Privcy Shield is the 
replaement for the now defeated Safe Harbour rule. Both 
Safe Harbour and Privacy Shield aim to protect EU citsens 
data being  stored on servers located in the US. This is 
only accpacble if the company storeing the data can 
ensure it is complying with the guidles outlines in the 
framworks. 

# What is Safe Harbour

## whats wrong with it 

Safe harbour was an agrement which allowed companines to store data from european citizens in servers locatated outside of the EU. This enabled compaines like google and facebook to keep any data they may have on EU citizens in servers located in the US. Under Safe Harbour this was fine as long as where the data was being stored was scure.
    While Safe Harbour is not a law itself but a regulation that allows the compaines that follow it assurances that they are complying with the rules that are in place for data production and privacy for eu citizens. What this meant for compaines was that if they followed Safe Harbour they would be comply with the Data Protection Drirective 


With the Snodwon revalations it showed that US agenies 
NSA was undertaken a mass survailce on US cistens. This 
was being done on a indascrimet basis by access servers 
which could have had both US and EU cistizen data. This is 
a vilaltion on EU rights and in turn violates the Safe 
Harbour framework. Safe Harbour in itself is not a law but 
rather a guideline for compaines to andhear too. As there 
are some very strict laws in place with europan citezens 
data and how it can be stored and transfered. following 
the guidelines allow compaines to have the reasureanice 
that they are in compliance with any law.
