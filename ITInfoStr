	Bring your own device (BYOD) in IT Organisations
---

# why did it come about #

- at first it was very diffcult to get email of phone or outside the office so once people were able to they got use to it very quickly. compaines also like having staff that could reply to emails all the time. this became a big advantage for the compaines that could reply to emails as they could comunincate much better with staff then before. allowing staff to work together better when out of the office. As more and more compaines started having staff with acces to there email it no longer became an advantage but a requirment.  



# What is BYOD #

you can't stop people from bring there device to work. they are always going to have there phone on them. at this stage its more about how you can best mange that device. Better training for staff. Not allowing them you use there phones, computers or tablets for work. company data being leaked could be very bad for the compaines image or scureity. With new regulations companies can no longer hide about this information got out there.
